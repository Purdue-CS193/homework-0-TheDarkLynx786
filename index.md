# Favorite things about CS 19300 so far

## This is a bulleted list! (such wow)
- Terminal commands
- That's kind of it for now really
- I already kind of knew most of the terminal commands thanks to WSL usage and CTF challenges
- but I guess learning emacs was fun
- uhhh yeah that's it cool class
- it's hosted in a cool room
- the room has a big mirror on the ceiling for some reason
- should have written this in HTML or something I could have added a script tag and made a fun little animation using JS
- but nobody likes JS so it's valid
