I'm not sure how to exactly complete this assignment, as I already have a website through GitHub pages hosted [here](thedarklynx.com) a the custom url as well \(thedarklynx.com\)

Also, I am developing more websites through NextJS, find either website-code-portfolio or website-code-nextjs and if you have npm installed then just run it through npm run dev and check out the site (website-code-nextjs IS under active development).

Also, I'm not sure when you will be seeing this, but I want to apologize for not attending the first lecture. I wasn't feeling well, and I did not think to make contact because I had wrongly assumed that this was a lab-related class.
